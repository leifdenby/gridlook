## Try It Live

Try out the example dataset:

https://gridlook.pages.dev

You can view any CORS-enabled, public Zarr dataset with GridLook:

```
https://gridlook.pages.dev/#<ZARR_URI>
```

## Project Setup

This project uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Usage

The project is served at http://localhost:3000/ when you run `npm run dev`.

Default dataset path and default variable are configured in
`public/runtime-config.js`:

```js
window.__GRIDLOOK_CONFIG__ = {
  defaultDatasetPath: "static/index_mr_dpp0066.json",
  defaultVariableName: "",
};
```

`GRIDLOOK_DEFAULT_VARIABLE_NAME` is optional and only used if that variable exists
in the currently loaded dataset.

For containerized production runtime configuration, see `DEVELOPING.md`.

## CORS & Hosting Notes

To load datasets from services like DKRZ Swift, ensure [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) is enabled on the server.

Example for the nextGEMS container on Swift:

```
swift post nextGEMS -m "X-Container-Meta-Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*"
```

This allows GridLook to fetch data directly from the container in your browser.
